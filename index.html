		<h1>Introducing Benjy!</h1>
		<img src="benjy.jpg" width="600px" height="450px">

		<p>Benjy Sachs is a student at CUNY's Newmark Graduate School of Journalism. He is interested in covering climate change, mass incarceration, and urban design. He has written for <i>Capital & Main</i>, <i>Boulder Reporting Lab</i>, and the Department of Energy.</p>

		<p>Here are some of his favorite journalism stories.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/90837/say-nothing-by-patrick-radden-keefe/" target="_blank">
			Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland</a> - I loved this book because the writing and narrative
			are so cinematic it feels like reading a novel. The fact it's all true makes it even better.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-plant-that-sterilizes-medical-equipment-spews-cancer-causing-pollution-on-tens-of-thousands-of-schoolchildren" target="_blank">A Plant That Sterilizes Medical Equipment Spews Cancer-Causing Pollution on Tens of Thousands
		of Schoolchildren</a> - This ProPublica piece put the story of the health crisis around an industrial polluter on the map and led to outrage, organizing, and an EPA visit to Laredo. In addition to data and maps, the writing and photography also painted a devastating portrait of the crisis' impact on one girl's life.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.earhustlesq.com/" target="_blank"><i>Ear Hustle</i></a> - One of my all-time favorite podcasts, Ear
		Hustle offers an honest, sometimes jovial, sometimes tragic, look at life behind bars. As a former volunteer at San Quentin, I learned a lot about the institution and the people who live there.</li>
